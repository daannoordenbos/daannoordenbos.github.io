# Blockudoku
Blockudoku is a puzzle game and it is described as “An original combination of Sudoku and block puzzle games”. During game play one gets three pieces (drawn from a selection) which they need to place down on the board, a 9x9 grid. If a line is filled or one of the nine 3x3 Sudoku boxes is filled, it is cleared and points are rewarded. The lines are cleared in between piece placements if they can be cleared, so one does not need to be able to place all pieces at ones. Then if one has placed all three pieces, it repeats and one again gets three new random pieces. This continues until one cannot place all three pieces, then the game is terminated.
