# Edwin de Jonge (1716) - Daan Noordenbos (2107)
## NOSBO (3), 2022.03.01
**1.d4** **&#9816;f6** **2.c4** **g6** **3.&#9816;f3** **&#9815;g7** **4.&#9816;c3** **O-O** **5.e4** **d6** **6.&#9815;e2** **&#9816;bd7** The sideline that I often use against weaker players to avoid the exchange variation of the Kings Indian Defence **7.O-O** **e5** **8.dxe5** **dxe5** **9.&#9813;c2** **&#9816;h5** 

*9...c6* This move is the computer choice. However it does weaking d6 and since white is still very flexible he can often play Nf3-d2-c4-d6 
**10.g3** **&#9816;c5!?** Trying to quickly take the d4 square **11.&#9815;e3** 

*11.&#9814;d1* *&#9813;e8* *12.&#9816;d5* *&#9816;e6* *13.&#9816;g5* This is annoying *&#9816;xg5* *14.&#9815;xg5* *f6* *15.&#9815;e3* *&#9814;f7* *16.&#9815;xh5* 

16.g4 &#9816;f4 17.&#9816;xf4 exf4 18.&#9815;xf4 Adn white has a clear advantage 
*16...gxh5* During the game I thought that this would be fine 
**11...&#9816;e6** **12.&#9814;fd1** **&#9816;d4?** Based on a miscalculation 

*12...&#9813;e8* White has an edge here but black can still attack with f7-f5 
**13.&#9816;xd4** **exd4** **14.&#9816;b5** 

*14.c5* {D|> This was critical, but I thought that this would be fine. *c6* *15.&#9815;xh5* *gxh5* *16.&#9816;e2* This is rather strong *&#9815;g4* This does not actually do that much *17.&#9815;xd4* *&#9815;xe2* *18.&#9815;xg7* *&#9815;xd1* *19.&#9814;xd1+-* 
**14...c5** **15.&#9815;xh5** **gxh5** **16.&#9815;f4** **&#9815;g4** **17.&#9814;e1** {D|> This is the line I wanted when I played Nd4, I thought that a knight on d6 would not be that active. however I missed that Nb5-c7-d5 plants the knight firmly on d5 **&#9813;d7** **18.&#9813;d3** 

*18.&#9816;c7* *d3* *19.&#9813;d2* *f5* This was my intention *20.&#9816;xa8* 

20.exf5+- 
*20...fxe4* *21.&#9814;xe4* *&#9815;f3* *22.&#9814;e3* *&#9814;xf4* *23.&#9814;xd3* *&#9814;d4* *24.&#9814;xd4* *cxd4* *25.&#9814;e1* And white can actually defend 
**f5** 

*18...&#9814;ae8!* *19.&#9815;d6* *a6* *20.&#9815;xf8* *&#9814;xf8* *21.&#9816;a3* *f5* And the inactive knight is decisive 
**19.f3** **fxe4** **20.fxe4** **a6** This is a nasty suprise, now it is lost **21.&#9816;a3** **h4** **22.&#9816;b1** **&#9815;h3** **23.&#9816;d2** **&#9814;xf4** A cute finish 
 0-1
